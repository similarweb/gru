============


How to file an issue
--------------------

To file an issue, please go to the `Github Issues page`_.

Make sure you follow these guidelines:

1. Give as much context as you can. Please describe:
    - The flow of actions leading to the issue
    - The GRU version used
    - The Python version used
    - Docker version used, if applicable
    - Operating system and version
    - Links to all installed open source plugins
    - Your gru.yaml configuration file

2. Be polite. GRU is an open source project. People choose to contribute to it out of their desire to better our community and tools. Please treat them with respect and kindness.

3. Make sure your issue hasn't been filed yet. It is likely that someone else has already encountered the same problem as you. Search the open and recently closed issues for ones similar to yours.


How to contribute
-----------------

GRU is an open source project and contributions are highly encouraged!

In order to work together productively, please follow these contribution guidelines:

1. Before submitting a pull request with a new feature, please open an issue, tagging it with ``Feature Request``. This is a community driven project and there will likely be some discussion on what the optimal solution is. This discussion might affect how and whether this feature should exist.

2. Make sure your code submission respects the coding style of its surrounding code. As a rule of thumb for new files, make sure you respect PEP8_.

3. If code changes any documented behaviour, make sure the documentation is updated as well. We will not merge pull requests that end up breaking current documentation.
